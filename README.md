A sample work on setting up Serenity for testing APIs with a custom reporting

Import the project as maven project, execute using maven clean install.
Once successfully executed, Serenity reports will be generated in project/target/site/serenity folder
Custom report will be generated in folder mentioned in properties file

Note:
With addition to Serenity report, I have scripted for custom high level reporting in the framework. Serenity reports are little bulky to share. The custom report has high level test reporting done.
